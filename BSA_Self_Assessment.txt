## Task 1: User Creation Automation
- Implemented the shell script to read users from CSV and create Linux users.
- Handled sudo group assignments and home directory setup.
- Verified by adding test users (e.g., linus.torvalds, ada.lovelace, raman).

## Task 2: Backup Script Automation
- Developed interactive shell script to create `.tar.gz` backups of user-specified directories.
- Script handles directory creation, error checking, and output logs.

## Git & Version Control
- Set up Git repository at: https://github.com/Ramandeep1003/os-automation-assignment
- Used branches for feature updates (e.g., add-new-user).
- Final version pushed to `main`.

## Reflection
- This assignment helped me understand Linux user management, permission handling, and scripting automation.
- Learned how to use Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration.
- Improved skills in Bash scripting and troubleshooting permission issues.

## Challenges
- Faced permission errors writing to `/var/log/` and resolved them with `sudo`.
- Learned to manage Git branches and push changes properly.

## Conclusion
I believe I have met all the criteria of the assignment. All tasks are functional and documented in the README.md file.
